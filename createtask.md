# Written responses

Part A

| Section | Question | Answer | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| i| Describe the overall purpose of the program | The purpose of the program is to give the user a short quiz to test their knowledge on recent facts about the MLB.  |
| ii| Describes what functionality of the program is demonstrated in the video| The video demonstrates the functionality of the responses given by the user to each question and the precedure thelling them if it is right or wrong. |
| iii| Describes the input and output of the program demonstrated in the video| The input is when the user types in their answer to the baseball question and the output is the program telling the user if they are right or wrong. |

Part B

| Section | Question | Answer | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| i | The first program code segment must show how data have been stored in the list. | ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89219498/163754819-2a098b86-96ae-448a-b39c-aabe39425116.png) <br> This is a list of the questions being asked to the user as well as the correct answers to those questions.|
| ii| The second program code segment must show the data in the same list being used, such as creating new data from the existing data or accessing multiple elements in the list, as part of fulfilling the program’s purpose.| ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89219498/163754899-b08c6afc-3943-411d-9c7c-2e0446240d1b.png) <br> This part of the code shows the questions being displayed in a loop as well as the users response being compared to the correct answer to determine if the user is correct. |
| iii | Identifies the name of the list being used in this response| ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89219498/163755012-d18ec4bf-67dd-48c8-bac7-c45fb225c0d3.png)|
| iv | Describes what the data contained in the list represent in your program| The data in the first list is the questions being asked to the user and the data in the second list is the correct answers to those questions. |
| v | Explains how the selected list manages complexity in your program code by explaining why your program code could not be written, or how it would be written differently, if you did not use the list| The first list is important because it contains all of the questions that are being asked to the user. The questions could be displayed individually, but that would make the code more complicated and unnecesarily long. The second list is especially important because it contains all of the answers to the questions being asked to the user. Without this, you would need individual if else statements to within the function which would make the code much longer than it needs to be. |

Part C

| Section | Question | Answer | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| i| The first program code segment must be a student-developed procedure that: Defines the procedure’s name and return type (if necessary), contains and uses one or more parameters that have an effect on the functionality of the procedure, and implements an algorithm that includes sequencing, selection and iteration| ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89219498/163755061-884e7737-99ff-481f-901d-63c9afb7a060.png) <br> This shows the function that uses a for loop to make each question only appear once and within that, displays the questions, asks for the user's input, and determines if the user is correct or not. |
| ii| The second program code segment must show where your student-developed procedure is being called in your program| ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89219498/163755158-784c9504-62b9-498b-aecb-9b9d7eb02c6b.png) <br> Near the beginning of the function, the question variable is called and displayed on the page, and later, the answer variable is called to be compared with the input. |
|iii |Describes in general what the identified procedure does and how it contributes to the overall functionality of the program | The function displays the questions that are being asked to the user and determines if the user's response is right or wrong. |
|iv | Explains in detailed steps how the algorithm implemented in the identified procedure works. Your explanation must be detailed enough for someone else to recreate it.| The algorithm first loops the function through all of the values in the list of questions. It then displays each question individually and creates a place for the user to type their answer. Finally, it compares the user's answer to the correct answer, and tells the user if they are right or wrong. |

Part D:

| Section | Question | Answer | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| i| Describes two calls to the procedure identified in written response3c. Each call must pass a different argument(s) that causes a different segment of code in the algorithm to execute.| The function displaying the questions and comparing the answers is called to display that information on the page and the question variable is called to display the questions so the user knows what they are answering.|
| ii| Describes what condition(s) is being tested by each call to the procedure| The condition being tested for is whether the user's answer is correct or not since this determines whether the program tells them that they are correct or incorrect. |
| iii| Identifies the result of each call| ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89219498/163755204-b4e8f23b-7a2d-4211-917f-58f9e4b1a67d.png) <br> When the function is called, the questions and the place for the user's input are displayed and the input is determined to be right or wrong. When the question variable is called, it displays one of the questions in the list until the previous question has been answered. |
