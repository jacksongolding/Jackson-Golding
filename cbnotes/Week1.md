  - Folding@Home - Folds proteins
- Science affected by using disctributed computing to solve problems
- Citizen science is research conducted by distributed individuals using their own devices
- Human capabilities enhanced by collaboration in computing
- Innovations with crowdsourcing
  - Spotify
    - Collaborative playlists
    - Algorithm
    - Metadata write-in
  - Crowdfunding
    - Kickstarter

- Crowdsourcing is obtaining input from a large number of people
- Croundsourcing creates new ways to collaborate

### GitHub Action

1. With the students in CSP right now, a crowdsourcing example would be to get information about how many hours the students spend coding at home for the class. A simple way to initiate would be to survey thhe people in all of the classes
2. Throughout all of Del Norte, a possible crowdsourcing example would be to determine the most common favorite school subject by surveying a large number of students about what their favorite subject is.

### Notes

- Netflix has explicit data
  - Thumbs up or down
  - Name, address
- Implicit data
  - When you watch
  - What you watched
  - Style of show commonly chosen
- Bias
  - Netflix exclusives featured ahead of other things
  - Subscriptions
- Computing innovations reflect human biases because of biases written into the algorithms
- Loan Company Example:
  - Software assisting loan officers
  - Find trends in successful loans
  - Reject people not fitting trends:
    - Age
    - Gender
    - Race/Ethnicity
- Programmers should reduce bias in algorithms to combat human biases
- Biases can be embedded at all levels of development
  - All software can be biased, wether it is intentional or not

### GitHub Action

I do not think the owner thought the bias was intentional. Throughout the video, he seemed like he had a somewhat joking tone which makes it seem like he just thought it was interesting the the tracking on the webcam didn't work for him, and did with his white coworker. This bias is harmful because it causes certain people to be unable to use that feature of the computer even though it wasn't intended to be that way. It should be corrected by focusing specifically on that issue and making sure that the problem is solved quickly.
