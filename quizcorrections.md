I did not remember how to convert hexadecimal into decimal. In order to convert 56 into decimal, you would multiply the rightmost digit, 6, by 16 to the 0 power, and add
that to the digit to the left, 5, multiplied by 16 to the 1 power. This would result in the answer of 86.

### Question 24

Packets do not have anything to do with encryption. They just hold and carry data across the Internet along with metadata that makes sure the packet is routed correctly.

I was not sure about what the option meant by a trade-off. I believe it means that sometimes, both types of data compression, lossy and lossless, are used to transfer 
data.

Not all code will be able to run individually. There will always be parts of the code that depend on something else, so at some point, you will run out of pieces of the code that can run individually which is when parallel solutions will no longer help.

### Question 8

I didn't think it made sense for the developer to not give free or low cost help with the software, but I think that option may be saying that they will always provide
support, which may not always be the case.

### Question 32

I was confused because it said that the 4 directions used 4 bits even though 3 bits would be able to carry that much information. I knew that having 8 directions would only require 4 bits, but I second-guessed myself because of the 4 bits being used for 4 pieces of information.
