# Quiz Corrections

## Quiz 1

### Question 6

I did not remember how to convert hexadecimal into decimal. In order to convert 56 into decimal, you would multiply the rightmost digit, 6, by 16 to the 0 power, and add
that to the digit to the left, 5, multiplied by 16 to the 1 power. This would result in the answer of 86.

### Question 24

Packets do not have anything to do with encryption. They just hold and carry data across the Internet along with metadata that makes sure the packet is routed correctly.

### Question 28

I was not sure about what the option meant by a trade-off. I believe it means that sometimes, both types of data compression, lossy and lossless, are used to transfer 
data.

## Quiz 2

### Question 1

Not all code will be able to run individually. There will always be parts of the code that depend on something else, so at some point, you will run out of pieces of the code that can run individually which is when parallel solutions will no longer help.

### Question 8

I didn't think it made sense for the developer to not give free or low cost help with the software, but I think that option may be saying that they will always provide
support, which may not always be the case.

### Question 32

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89219498/165031998-2bcac7f1-ec31-4cfc-aa38-d59339aea203.png)

I was confused because it said that the 4 directions used 4 bits even though 3 bits would be able to carry that much information. I knew that having 8 directions would only require 4 bits, but I second-guessed myself because of the 4 bits being used for 4 pieces of information.

## Quiz 3

### Question 2

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89219498/166408640-1d2aa3eb-d4a6-45a8-9444-eaf00228187f.png)

It made sense to me that with a big enough algorithm, any problem could be solved if there is enough data. However, even though most problems can be solved algorithmically, there are still some that can't be.

### Question 12

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89219498/166408863-e6c4db92-ef5d-433d-8337-21401a53653e.png)

I misunderstood the response I chose as work changing from being copywritten to having a Creative Commons license. Work that was previously copywritten will still keep its restrictions after a Creative Commons license is used.

### Question 18

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89219498/166409127-da61b085-9006-4ce1-84ee-2e05c0d0b8dc.png)

I believed that the code segment would just return false no matter what since after the loop, it says to return false. However, since the 1 at the end of the list (-1, 0, 1) will get the program to return true, it wouldn't work because the list does not only contain positive numbers.

### Question 34

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89219498/166409435-dc8d0df4-93fc-4928-a6b1-56412a9051a7.png)

I didn't remember what a heuristic was. A heuristic is a strategy meant to solve a problem that would otherwise be too slow or not solveable. Finding the fastest route takes n! routes which means that it will not run in reasonable time, and therefore will require a heuristic.

### Question 42

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89219498/166409678-8c0b83f4-5521-49e7-9f8f-442a2d7fce2d.png)

I did the math wrong and thought that 8 bits would store 128 items, even though it would store 256 items. Therefore, it would have to be 7 bits instead.
