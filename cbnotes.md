1. Computing example: Shooter Game
- Benefits: They can be fun games; at certain skill levels, it can stimulate your brain when creating strategies; Can be a somewhat social experience
- Harmful: Can create bad physical habits; Limits the users exercise; Can be seen as promoting violence  
2. The dopamine hit that comes from video games and social media is only harmful if you aren't using it properly. If someone spends all of their time worrying about their online presence, then it is harmful. But if the user can balance their use of video games and social media with social interactions and exercise, then I see it as much more beneficial.

### GitHub Action

1. Someone can empower themselves in a digital world by helping people gain access to and understand computers and the internet. They can also find a way to spread factual information across the internet to inform people about things that are happening.
2. Someone that is empowered when it comes to technology can help someone that is not empowered by giving them experience with computers and showing them how many features work. Something that could be done at Del Norte is to show people tricks on computers that can prove extremely useful in common situations.
3. There is red tape blocking digital empowerment for many people because internet access is not something that everyone is privileged with. Many people are either not allowed to use the internet, or are unable to afford technology. I think Del Norte does not have too much of that, since Del Norte is in a very nice area which most likely means that most students have access to some type of technology. In many other countries, that lack of internet access is very much more common because of government restrictions as well as people's beliefs about technology.
