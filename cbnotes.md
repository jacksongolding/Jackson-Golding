# College Board Notes

# 5.6

### Notes

- Personally Identifiable Information (PII) - info specific to an individual
- PII can be used to steal someone's identity
- Search engines keep a history of your searches - suggest websites based on that info
- Location can also be collected
- PII can be used to enhance someone's experience
- PII can be dangerous if protections are ignored
- PII is used by all sorts of things, people have little control over who sees their info
- Online information is hard to delete
- Authentication protects devices from unauthorized access
  - Strong passwords
  - Multi-factor authentication
- Virus - malicious programs that copy themselves to access systems they shouldn't be able to access
- Malware - intended to damage a computing system or control it
- Virus scans help prevent malicious code from entering your system
- Important to ensure data stays uncompromised
- Encryption - process of encoding data to prevent unauthorized access
  - Symmetric encryption - one key used for encryption and decryption
  - Asymmetric encryption
- Decryption - process of decoding data
- Public Key Enryption - uses 2 keys
  - Public key for encryption
  - Private key for deryption
- Sender does not need receiver's private key
- Reciever's private key required for decryption
- Certificate authorities give digital certificates to validate ownership of encryption keysin secure communications
- Phishing - attempt to trick someone into giving personal information
  - Commonly are emails that look like a company you trust
  - Have links that they trick you into opening
    - Installs viruses
    - Spoofed banking website
    - Keylogger installed - records keystrokes made by a user to get fraudulent access to passwords
- Rogue Access Point - wireless network that gives unauthorized access to secure networks

### GitHub Action

1. An example of PII in a CompSci Principles project could include the about me pages which give information about the creators of the website.
2. I feel like I am pretty safe about how I use my PII because I am very skeptical about a lot of things, even if I am almost one hundred percent sure that it is safe
3. A good password is something that has a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols that would not be common sense to figure out. A bad password may just have letters or numbers that could also relate to you, making it easier to figure out. Another common way to ensure authentication is by using something like Google Authhenticator which gives you a random code every minute or so in order for it to be almost impossible to figure it out.
4. Symmetric encryption is when only one key is used for both encryption and decryption while asymmetric encryption uses a key for encryption and a seperate key for decryption
5. In deployment, an example of encryption is using CertBot to get the website on a secure server and making it https instead of http.
6. I don't think that I've had any clear experiences of being the victim of phishing, but I have gotten DM's from people that I know, but not very well, that gave me a link to get something for free. I knew it was very suspicious, so I closely investigated the link and saw that it was slightly different than what the actual website would be and knew that I shouldn't click it.

### Notes

- Intellectual Property (IP) - work or invention resulting from creativity to which one has rights
- Copyright protects IP and keeps people from using it without permission
- Plagiarism - claiming someone else's material as your own
- Legal ways to use material created by others
  - Creative Commons - provides free licenses to tell others how you want them to use your work
  - Open source - programs freely available for anyone to use
  - Open access - online research output free of restrictions

### GitHub Action

1. Creative Commons - removes copyright on your work, making it public for all people to use
   MIT - Work is used freely and closed sources can be easily made and distributed
   GPL - Lets people use your work, but does not allow you to distribute closed sources
2. We used an MIT License because it gives a lot of freedom to the user and makes closed sources easy to make and distribute

# 5.4

### Notes

- Public Data Sets
  - Kaggle
    - Visualization courses, machine learning
    - Competitions
    - Notebooks
  - Google Public Datasets
    - Free for 1 terabyte
    - All-in-one, uses BigQuery
  - Data.gov
    - Government data
    - Agriculture, energy, water, health
  - Your local government
    - Keeps them accountable
    - Helps find solutions and trends
- Widespread access to info and data makes it easier t find problems and create solutions
- Distributed Computing - Sends things to computers that volunteer to help solve problems
  - Folding@Home - Folds proteins
- Science affected by using disctributed computing to solve problems
- Citizen science is research conducted by distributed individuals using their own devices
- Human capabilities enhanced by collaboration in computing
- Innovations with crowdsourcing
  - Spotify
    - Collaborative playlists
    - Algorithm
    - Metadata write-in
  - Crowdfunding
    - Kickstarter
    - IndieGoGo
  - Blockchain
    - Cryptocurrency
- Crowdsourcing is obtaining input from a large number of people
- Croundsourcing creates new ways to collaborate

### GitHub Action

1. With the students in CSP right now, a crowdsourcing example would be to get information about how many hours the students spend coding at home for the class. A simple way to initiate would be to survey thhe people in all of the classes
2. Throughout all of Del Norte, a possible crowdsourcing example would be to determine the most common favorite school subject by surveying a large number of students about what their favorite subject is.

### Notes

- Netflix has explicit data
  - Thumbs up or down
  - Name, address
- Implicit data
  - When you watch
  - What you watched
  - Style of show commonly chosen
- Bias
  - Netflix exclusives featured ahead of other things
  - Subscriptions
- Computing innovations reflect human biases because of biases written into the algorithms
- Loan Company Example:
  - Software assisting loan officers
  - Find trends in successful loans
  - Reject people not fitting trends:
    - Age
    - Gender
    - Race/Ethnicity
- Programmers should reduce bias in algorithms to combat human biases
- Biases can be embedded at all levels of development
  - All software can be biased, wether it is intentional or not

### GitHub Action

I do not think the owner thought the bias was intentional. Throughout the video, he seemed like he had a somewhat joking tone which makes it seem like he just thought it was interesting the the tracking on the webcam didn't work for him, and did with his white coworker. This bias is harmful because it causes certain people to be unable to use that feature of the computer even though it wasn't intended to be that way. It should be corrected by focusing specifically on that issue and making sure that the problem is solved quickly.

# 5.2

### Notes

- Internet access depends on socioeconomic, geographic, demographic, and country related situations
- Digital divide is based on the different amount of access to computers and the internet
- Socioeconomic - amount of income to the household
- Geographic - If their aren't many people where someone lives, they may not have access to fast internet
- Demographics - Things like age and religion
- Some countries
  - Computers uncommon in rural areas
  - Limited number of websites
  - Internet can only be used if protecting and advocating for the government
  - High surveillance on the internet
- Digital divide affects groups and individuals
- Digital divide brings up issues of equity, access, and influence
- Digital divide affected by actions of individuals, organizations, and governments

### GitHub Action

1. Someone can empower themselves in a digital world by helping people gain access to and understand computers and the internet. They can also find a way to spread factual information across the internet to inform people about things that are happening.
2. Someone that is empowered when it comes to technology can help someone that is not empowered by giving them experience with computers and showing them how many features work. Something that could be done at Del Norte is to show people tricks on computers that can prove extremely useful in common situations.
3. There is red tape blocking digital empowerment for many people because internet access is not something that everyone is privileged with. Many people are either not allowed to use the internet, or are unable to afford technology. I think Del Norte does not have too much of that, since Del Norte is in a very nice area which most likely means that most students have access to some type of technology. In many other countries, that lack of internet access is very much more common because of government restrictions as well as people's beliefs about technology.

### Notes

- Accelerometers are based on acceleration.
- Cars use accelerometers to determine when it should release an airbag
- People change how they do things in order to use new innovations
- Multirotor: 
  - Benefit - Deliveries, finding people, aerial photography
  - Harmful - Flying in certain places is illegal, privacy
- Wii controller:
  - Benefit - People are active while playing video games
  - Harmful - Breaking things and chance of injury
- Not all effects of innovations are expected before-hand
- Certain effects can be seen as beneficial or harmful depending on who looks at it
- Computing innovations are created by people
- Computing advancements create increased creativity in other fields
- Internet originally meant for science - now a lot of people use it
  - The internet gives the users dopamine
  - Internet can lead to sleep depravation, depression, anxiety, and impulsivity
- Innovations can be used in ways that weren't intended
- Good programmers consider unintended was their innovation can be used and the effects of them
- Microtransactions - small purchases in a game
  - Commonly seen in free games and apps
  - Gives you cosmetics, paywall to functionality, or pay-to-win
- Some ways innovations are used can be harmful to society, economy, and culture
- A programmer can't consider all ways of an innovation being used

### GitHub Action

1. Computing example: Shooter Game
- Benefits: They can be fun games; at certain skill levels, it can stimulate your brain when creating strategies; Can be a somewhat social experience
- Harmful: Can create bad physical habits; Limits the users exercise; Can be seen as promoting violence  
2. The dopamine hit that comes from video games and social media is only harmful if you aren't using it properly. If someone spends all of their time worrying about their online presence, then it is harmful. But if the user can balance their use of video games and social media with social interactions and exercise, then I see it as much more beneficial.
