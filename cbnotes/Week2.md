# College Board Notes 5.5 and 5.6

# 5.6

### Notes

- Personally Identifiable Information (PII) - info specific to an individual
- PII can be used to steal someone's identity
- Search engines keep a history of your searches - suggest websites based on that info
- Location can also be collected
- PII can be used to enhance someone's experience
- PII can be dangerous if protections are ignored
- PII is used by all sorts of things, people have little control over who sees their info
- Online information is hard to delete
- Authentication protects devices from unauthorized access
  - Strong passwords
  - Multi-factor authentication
- Virus - malicious programs that copy themselves to access systems they shouldn't be able to access
- Malware - intended to damage a computing system or control it
- Virus scans help prevent malicious code from entering your system
- Important to ensure data stays uncompromised
- Encryption - process of encoding data to prevent unauthorized access
  - Symmetric encryption - one key used for encryption and decryption
  - Asymmetric encryption
- Decryption - process of decoding data
- Public Key Enryption - uses 2 keys
  - Public key for encryption
  - Private key for deryption
- Sender does not need receiver's private key
- Reciever's private key required for decryption
- Certificate authorities give digital certificates to validate ownership of encryption keysin secure communications
- Phishing - attempt to trick someone into giving personal information
  - Commonly are emails that look like a company you trust
  - Have links that they trick you into opening
    - Installs viruses
    - Spoofed banking website
    - Keylogger installed - records keystrokes made by a user to get fraudulent access to passwords
- Rogue Access Point - wireless network that gives unauthorized access to secure networks

### GitHub Action

1. An example of PII in a CompSci Principles project could include the about me pages which give information about the creators of the website.
2. I feel like I am pretty safe about how I use my PII because I am very skeptical about a lot of things, even if I am almost one hundred percent sure that it is safe
3. A good password is something that has a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols that would not be common sense to figure out. A bad password may just have letters or numbers that could also relate to you, making it easier to figure out. Another common way to ensure authentication is by using something like Google Authhenticator which gives you a random code every minute or so in order for it to be almost impossible to figure it out.
4. Symmetric encryption is when only one key is used for both encryption and decryption while asymmetric encryption uses a key for encryption and a seperate key for decryption
5. In deployment, an example of encryption is using CertBot to get the website on a secure server and making it https instead of http.
6. I don't think that I've had any clear experiences of being the victim of phishing, but I have gotten DM's from people that I know, but not very well, that gave me a link to get something for free. I knew it was very suspicious, so I closely investigated the link and saw that it was slightly different than what the actual website would be and knew that I shouldn't click it.

### Notes

- Intellectual Property (IP) - work or invention resulting from creativity to which one has rights
- Copyright protects IP and keeps people from using it without permission
- Plagiarism - claiming someone else's material as your own
- Legal ways to use material created by others
  - Creative Commons - provides free licenses to tell others how you want them to use your work
  - Open source - programs freely available for anyone to use
  - Open access - online research output free of restrictions

### GitHub Action

1. - Creative Commons - removes copyright on your work, making it public for all people to use
   - MIT - Work is used freely and closed sources can be easily made and distributed
   - GPL - Lets people use your work, but does not allow you to distribute closed sources
2. We used an MIT License because it gives a lot of freedom to the user and makes closed sources easy to make and distribute
