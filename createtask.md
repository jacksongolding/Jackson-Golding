I want to create a game similar to the card game war.

- Input will be when the user pushes a button to place a "card"
- Lists will be used to store all of the different cards
- Iteration will be used to repeat the same code after a round is complete
- Output will be the card placed by the user and the card placed by the computer
- Sequencing will be in Python
- Comments and captions to explain what is happening
